    <h2>About <b>Sqebeqsed Stories</b></h2>
    <p>Welcome to the stories of Southeast Seattle’s Seward Park, home to the city’s last old-growth forest.</p>
    <p>“Place is a story happening many times.” So say the Kwakiutl people of coastal British Columbia.</p>
    <p>Seward Park is stories happening over and over, many at once. People come here to celebrate, congregate, meditate, race, run, walk, swim, climb, picnic, play, reflect, relax, make art, learn, unlearn, unwind. This place has sustained local residents for ten thousand years.</p>
    <p>Before it was named “Seward Park” a century ago, this forested peninsula jutting into Lake Washington was known as “Sqebeqsed,” or “fat nose” in the local language, Lushootseed. And so Seward Park Stories are <b>Sqebeqsed Stories</b>.</p>
    <p>Here, you will find stories about life in Sqebeqsed and the many lives that intersect with it, both human and non-human, present and past.</p>
